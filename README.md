# simpleCarouselJS
A jQuery plugin to create unstyled bare bone carousels with just the essential functionality available.

##Why ?
Too many projects required carousels with custom looks and animations but same basic functionality e.g
next, previous, dot navigation, play content animations during or after carousel animation is complete.

##Dependencies ?
* jQuery
* Greensock's TweenMax

##Whats available ?
* basic carousel controls
* optional dot pagination
* check wether carousel is currently on the last slide or first
* plenty of bindable events
* accepts custom animations to override the default animation

##What are the limitations ?
* assumes all slides will be the same height
* widths of carousels are % based to be more responsive
